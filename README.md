Seed Manager is free as in free speech and free beer.

# Description
The aim of Seed Manager is to manage a collection of seed using a graphical interface, and be able to sort them depending on their categories, name, and other informations. The current version is very simple, and allow the user to add and remove seeds and categories.

# TODO
More features are planned someday but so far there is no plan to continue adding features in the near future. Contributions are welcome though.

# Install

These libraries are required to use the program:
libglibmm-2.4
libgtkmm-3.0

# Building

These libraries are required for compiling on a Debian Stretch :
libglibmm-2.4-dev
libgtkmm-3.0-dev

running `make` from the command line in the root directory will compile the executable in a build/ directory.

# Installing

So far, there is no proper way to install the software. The database is created in the root directory of the project.
